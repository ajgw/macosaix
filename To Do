Ideas for future versions:
    Service
	Calculate match value of user chosen images
	Statistics drawer/window (matches per second, etc.)
	Width of status text problem (works when shown/hidden)
	Better versioning in documents (XML may satisfy this since DTD can be versioned)
	Should pause also pause uniqueness thread?
	Does save reset autosave clock?
	Indicate best unique match in editor table
	Disable 'center on selected tile' menu choice when not using Tiles or Editor tab
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options (resolution, SVG format, ...)
	Add code to support crop limit
	Autosave on/off switch
	Toggle outline switch in editor?
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Grayscale option
	Velocity engine
	XGrid
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		iSight source
		iTunes album art
		iPhoto albums
		flickr
	Directory source
		Option to only use images bigger or smaller than certain dimensions
		Alias support during enumeration
	Glyph source
		Color palettes
		Font selection
		Text selection (e.g. decl. of ind.)
	Don't use each tile more than x times

=======================================================================================

2.0x To Do:
¥	Make sure pixels are being pulled from bitmaps correctly
¥	Make neighborhood calculation more efficient or threaded
¥	Split MacOSaiXWindowController out of MacOSaiXDocument
¥	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.
¥	Pausing
¥	Buffered exporting
¥	Editor
¥	Test on Jaguar
¥	Rework prefs
¥	Enable image source removal (includes purging of its images...)
¥	Mosaic quality calculation should take into account each tile's percentage coverage of original image
¥	Get rid of lines in exporting
¥	Compare straight color match vs. Riemersma
¥	Version check
¥	Link to home page in About box or help menu
¥	Glyph source
¥	Minimum sizing for image source editor sheet

2.0a2 To Do:
Ã	Uniqueness
Ã	Image sources GUI (whole utility drawer, actually)
Ã	Recent originals in open panel
Ã	Make all image identifiers strings (still used as plist dictionary key?)
Ã	Change idle message
¥	Saving (plug-ins state)
¥	Image cache purging (on save)
¥	Get rid of framework? (+ rework plug-ins)
¥	Google source:
¥		Make sure cache doesn't fill disk
x	Original image view (scaling/tinting)
