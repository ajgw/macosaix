Ideas for future versions:
    Service
	Statistics drawer/window (matches per second, etc.)
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options
		SVG format
		vector output (Glyphs only?)
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		iSight source
		iTunes album art
		Delicious
	Directory source
		Option to only use images bigger or smaller than certain dimensions
	"option to replace ALL instances of one tile with another picture"
	Button/menu item to not use selected image anywhere.  (probably in editor)
	AppleScript support
	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.
	RSS feed
	Drag image from one tile to another to swap images.
	Cut and paste images between tiles.
