Ideas for future versions:
    Service
	Calculate match value of user chosen images
	Statistics drawer/window (matches per second, etc.)
	Width of status text problem (works when shown/hidden)
	Indicate best unique match in editor table
	Disable 'center on selected tile' menu choice when no tile is selected
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options
		resolution
		SVG format
		vector output (Glyphs only?)
	Add code to support crop limit
	Autosave on/off switch
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Velocity engine
	XGrid
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		iSight source
		iTunes album art
		flickr
	Directory source
		Option to only use images bigger or smaller than certain dimensions
		Alias support during enumeration
	"option to replace ALL instances of one tile with another picture"
	Button/menu item to not use selected image anywhere.  (probably in editor)
	AppleScript support
	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.
	RSS feed

Riemersma metric:
    http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/compuphase/cmetric.htm

=======================================================================================

2.x To Do:
¥	Buffered exporting (allow larger sizes)
¥	Compare straight color match vs. Riemersma
¥	New mosaic from image on clipboard
¥	Mosaic image source.  (use images from an existing mosaic) (Mark Everdell)
¥	Streaming QT source
	Image cache
¥		purge unused images in disk cache on save
	Preferences:
¥		What to display for non-unique tiles


2.0x To Do:
¥	Allow setup to be changed after mosaic has been started
¥	Make sure pixels are being pulled from bitmaps correctly
¥	Mosaic quality calculation should take into account each tile's percentage coverage of original image
¥	Get rid of lines in exporting
¥	Add preferences API for image source plug-ins
¥	Add preferences API for tile shapes plug-ins
¥	Resizing when zoomed does not stay centered and draws funky
¥	Rework puzzle shapes plug-in to conform with new API
	Google source:
¥		Make sure cache doesn't fill disk
	QuickTime source:
¥		Show aspect ratio
¥		Scale movie when sheet presented
¥		Recent movies
	Directory source:
¥		Recent directories
¥		Show more folder levels (outline view?)
	Glyphs source:
¥		Exception on pasting letters
¥		Use each letter once
¥		Remember previous choices
¥	Autosave pref checkbox
¥	DOCTYPE plist in XML?
¥	Window zooming
?	Tile refresh leaves black edges

2.0a5 To Do:
¥	Don't report crashes older than 2.0a4
¥	Make sure exporting still works with changes to image caching
¥	Editor
¥	Make sure manually chosen image identifiers are XML safe.
