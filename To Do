Ideas for future versions:
    Service
	Calculate match value of user chosen images
	Statistics drawer/window (matches per second, etc.)
	Width of status text problem (works when shown/hidden)
	Better versioning in documents (XML may satisfy this since DTD can be versioned)
	Does save reset autosave clock?
	Indicate best unique match in editor table
	Disable 'center on selected tile' menu choice when no tile is selected
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options
		resolution
		SVG format
		vector output (Glyphs only?)
	Add code to support crop limit
	Autosave on/off switch
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Grayscale option
	Velocity engine
	XGrid
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		iSight source
		iTunes album art
		iPhoto albums
		flickr
	Directory source
		Option to only use images bigger or smaller than certain dimensions
		Alias support during enumeration
	Glyph source
		Color palettes
		Font selection
		Text selection (e.g. decl. of ind.)
		Limit on images generated (so it doesn't overpower other sources)
	"option to replace ALL instances of one tile with another picture"
	Button/menu item to not use selected image anywhere.  (probably in editor)
	AppleScript support

=======================================================================================

2.0x To Do:
¥	Allow setup to be changed after mosaic has been started
¥	Make sure pixels are being pulled from bitmaps correctly
Ã	Make neighborhood calculation more efficient or threaded
¥	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.
¥	Buffered exporting (allow larger sizes)
¥	Editor
Ã	Rework prefs
Ã	Enable image source removal (includes purging of its images...)
¥	Mosaic quality calculation should take into account each tile's percentage coverage of original image
¥	Get rid of lines in exporting
¥	Compare straight color match vs. Riemersma
Ã	Link to home page in About box or help menu
¥	Resurrect Glyph source
¥	Sizing of tile shapes and image source editor sheets
¥	Add preferences API for image source plug-ins
¥	Add preferences API for tile shapes plug-ins
	Image cache
¥		purge unused images in disk cache on save
Ã	Rename Tiles class to MacOSaiXTile
¥	Resizing when zoomed does not stay centered.
¥	Preference/option for what to display for non-unique tiles.
¥	New mosaic from image on clipboard

2.0a2 To Do:
Ã	Uniqueness
Ã	Image sources GUI (whole utility drawer, actually)
Ã	Recent originals in open panel
Ã	Make all image identifiers strings (still used as plist dictionary key?)
Ã	Change idle message
Ã	Pausing
Ã	Split MacOSaiXWindowController out of MacOSaiXDocument
Ã	Rework tile shapes plug-in API to get rid of framework
Ã	Rework rectangular shapes plug-in to conform with new API
	Image cache
Ã		Make in-memory cache size, rather than count, dependent
Ã	Saving (+ plug-ins state)
Ã	Autosaving
Ã	Disable Save As... for now
Ã	Loading (+ plug-ins state)
Ã	Version check
Ã	Disable neighborhood size GUI
Ã	Limit better matches cache
Ã	Switch to showing mosaic when mosaic starts
Ã	Get zoom working again
Ã	Make image cache class level
Ã	Add ability to toggle between displaying original or mosaic.
Ã	Resume toolbar icon should read Start before mosaic has begun
Ã	"Show Tile Outlines" menu item should switch to "Hide Tile Outlines"
Ã	Rework hexagonal shapes plug-in to conform with new API
¥	Rework puzzle shapes plug-in to conform with new API
Ã	Make image count work with attributed descriptors
Ã	Export panel progress not updating
Ã	Limit export sizes to 10,000 pixels (NSWindow limit)
?	Make saved documents bundles
Ã	Handle failure to parse XML
Ã	Show average aspect ratio in setup
	Google source:
Ã		Meaningful description in table
?		Make sure cache doesn't fill disk
	QuickTime source:
¥		Show aspect ratio
¥		Scale movie when sheet presented
¥		Recent movies
	Directory source:
Ã		Find images by more than extension
¥		Recent directories
¥		Show more folder levels (outline view?)
x	Original image view (scaling/tinting)
	

=======================================================================================


For each image:
	For each tile:
		If image match better than current image match then add tile to list of possibles
*	Calculate which tiles should use the image based on user settings:
		Each image can be used 1-° times.
			and
		Tiles using the same image must be (some distance) apart.
	For each tile to update:
		Add tile's previous image to queue of images to match
		Set the tile's image to this image
