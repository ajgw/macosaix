Ideas for future versions:
    Service
	Calculate match value of user chosen images
	Statistics drawer/window (matches per second, etc.)
	Width of status text problem (works when shown/hidden)
	Indicate best unique match in editor table
	Disable 'center on selected tile' menu choice when no tile is selected
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options
		resolution
		SVG format
		vector output (Glyphs only?)
	Add code to support crop limit
	Autosave on/off switch
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Velocity engine
	XGrid
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		iSight source
		iTunes album art
		flickr
	Directory source
		Option to only use images bigger or smaller than certain dimensions
		Alias support during enumeration
	"option to replace ALL instances of one tile with another picture"
	Button/menu item to not use selected image anywhere.  (probably in editor)
	AppleScript support
	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.
	RSS feed

=======================================================================================

2.x To Do:
¥	Buffered exporting (allow larger sizes)
¥	Compare straight color match vs. Riemersma
¥	New mosaic from image on clipboard


2.0.0x To Do:
¥	Streaming QT source (2.1?)
¥	Allow setup to be changed after mosaic has been started
¥	Make sure pixels are being pulled from bitmaps correctly
¥	Editor
¥	Mosaic quality calculation should take into account each tile's percentage coverage of original image
¥	Get rid of lines in exporting
¥	Add preferences API for image source plug-ins
¥	Add preferences API for tile shapes plug-ins
	Image cache
¥		purge unused images in disk cache on save
¥	Resizing when zoomed does not stay centered and draws funky
	Preferences:
¥		What to display for non-unique tiles
¥		Auto-start on image source add
¥	Rework puzzle shapes plug-in to conform with new API
¥	Make sure saved documents are bundles
	Google source:
¥		Make sure cache doesn't fill disk
	QuickTime source:
¥		Show aspect ratio
¥		Scale movie when sheet presented
¥		Recent movies
	Directory source:
¥		Recent directories
¥		Show more folder levels (outline view?)
	Glyphs source:
¥		Exception on pasting letters
¥		Use each letter once
¥		Remember previous choices
¥	0x124c crashers (any others?)
¥	Window zooming
?	Tile refresh leaves black edges
¥	Export defaults to >10000 pixels for large original
¥	Check for new crash log(s)
