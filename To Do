This version:
    Test on G3 & Jaguar
?   Memory mgmt. issues

Need to be able to:
¥ Create new image source (from NewDocument, Document or Prefs windows)
	(need callback when source created)
¥ Edit existing image source (if mosaic has not begun)	
¥ Get next image identifier
¥ Get image for identifier
¥ Determine if there are any more images

Ideas for future versions:
    Service
Ã	Allow user to specify number of image matches kept for each tile.
Ã	Show tile extraction count in status bar
	Calculate match of user chosen images
	Statistics drawer/window (matches per second, etc.)
	Width of status text problem (works when shown/hidden)
	Better versioning in documents (XML may have done this since DTD can be versioned)
	Should pause also pause uniqueness thread?
	Does save reset autosave clock?
	Indicate best unique match in editor table
	Disable 'center on selected tile' menu choice when not using Tiles or Editor tab
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options (resolution, SVG format, ...)
	Add code to support crop limit
	Autosave on/off switch
Ã	Plug-in architecture for image sources and tile outlines
	Mosaic quality calculation should take into account tile active pixel count
	Toggle outline switch in editor?
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Grayscale option
	Velocity engine
	XGrid
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		iSight source
		iTunes album art
		iPhoto albums

=======================================================================================

Rework TODO:
¥	Make sure pixels are being pulled from bitmaps correctly
¥	Make all image identifiers strings (still used as plist dictionary key?)
¥	Make neighborhood calculation more efficient or threaded
¥	Split MacOSaiXWindowController out of MacOSaiXDocument
¥	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.
Ã	Uniqueness
¥	Saving (plug-ins state)
¥	Image sources GUI (whole utility drawer, actually)
¥	Get rid of framework?
¥	Hexagonal & puzzle tile shapes
¥	Glyph & Google sources
¥	Original image view (scaling/tinting)
¥	Pausing
¥	Buffered exporting
¥	Editor
¥	Disable editor until after mosaic has started
¥	Push regions to next major release
¥	Image cache purging (on save)


2.0a1 To Do:
Ã	Disable saving
¥	List of what is/isn't working
¥	Test on Jaguar
Ã	Activate newly added image sources
Ã	Enable remove source button or disable it
Ã	Purge image cache directory on document dealloc
¥	Disable tiles setup after mosaic starts?
Ã	Turn down priority of worker threads
¥	Change idle message


Working:
	Rectangular tiles
	Tile neighborhood/uniqueness control
	Directory source
	QuickTime source
	Exporting
	Pause/Resume

Not Working:
	Saving
	Preferences
	Hex Tiles
	Puzzle Tiles
	Google Source
	Glyph Source
	Removing Sources
	Editor
