Ideas for future versions:
	Statistics shee/drawer/window (matches per second, table with occurence counts, etc.)
	Trim solid borders for alternate image
	More export image panel options
		SVG format
		vector output (Glyphs only?)
	"Must include" images
	Printing (greeting card format?)
	Image regions
	New image sources:
		Icons
		Delicious
		Address Book person images
	Directory source
		Option to only use images bigger or smaller than certain dimensions
	"option to replace ALL instances of one tile with another picture"
	Button/menu item to not use selected image in the current mosaic.
	Button/menu item to not use selected image in any mosaic.
	AppleScript support
	Rework MosaicView to not use a stored image but redraw the tiles as needed in -drawRect:.  Would allow for better zooming.  OpenGL?  Could have cool effects...
	RSS feed (as source or for MacOSaiX web site?)
	Drag image from one tile to another to swap images.
	Cut and paste images between tiles.
	Have text entered into Glyphs appear linearly so it can be read. (paul@anglesnet.com)
